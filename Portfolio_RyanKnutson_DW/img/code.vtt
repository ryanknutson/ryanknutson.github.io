00:00:03.122 --> 00:00:05.541
Here we are 2013.

2
00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:09.461
We all depend on technology 
to communicate, to bank,

3
00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:12.492
and none of us know 
how to read and write code!

4
00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:15.160
The first program I wrote asked things like

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.722
"What's your favorite color?" or 
"How old are you?"

6
00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:20.577
I wrote a program to play tic-tac-toe.

7
00:00:20.577 --> 00:00:25.602
I first learned how to make a green circle 
in a red square appear on the screen.

8
00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:29.577
You're just trying to make something, 
trying to transfer something from your mind

9
00:00:29.577 --> 00:00:31.859
to the computer or to a tablet.

10
00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.653
It's a - it's a - it's an experience.

11
00:00:34.653 --> 00:00:38.826
The whole limit in the system is just 
that there just aren't enough people

12
00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:40.618
who are trained and 
have these skills today.

13
00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:43.204
The programmers of tomorrow 
are the wizards of the future.

14
00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:46.327
You know, you're going to look like 
you have magic powers compared to everybody else.

15
00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:48.889
Great coders are today's rock stars.

16
00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:52.398
That's it!
