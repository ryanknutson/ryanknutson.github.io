                Paul Nelson’s interest and love for animals started at an early age growing up on a dairy farm near Freistatt, Mo.  He graduated in 1976 from the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine and served three years as an Air Force veterinarian at Homestead AFB,  Florida before returning to practice for six years with friend and colleague Dr. Don McCormick at Monett Veterinary Hospital.  Dr. Nelson opened Country Hills Animal Hospital in April 1987 and has been blessed with a great staff providing quality professional pet care to the best people of the Ozarks. He takes pride in treating his patients with the same level of care and compassion as his own labrador Molly. Dr. Nelson considers his greatest blessings to be his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and his wonderful family. In his spare time, he enjoys an occasional round of golf and tending to his yard.

                Stephanie Mitchell had been a client of Country Hills for over ten years before becoming a part of the staff. An attorney by education, she has always had a passion for animals and found great homes for the variety of strays that have crossed her path. She has had a variety of jobs including Children’s Coordinator at a church, an attorney and various volunteer jobs. She grew up in Springfield but lived and worked in Hawaii and Florida before returning home to the Ozarks. Her current dogs include a Standard American Eskimo, a Weimaraner, a rescue Labrador Retriever and a rescue Mixed breed.  She also shares her home with a Persian cat and a rescue Mediumhair cat.  She enjoys working with the dogs in agility and tricks and especially loves halter training and ground work with her Arabian show horses.  Horse shows have been a part of her life for the past eight years, but she also enjoys trail riding and most outdoor activities with her family and pets as well as going to the lake and traveling. She has been married to Terry for nine years; although her two step-sons live out of town she is fortunate to have her three grown daughters living nearby. Growing up in Springfield has been a blessing and Ozark has been a wonderful place to raise a family.
